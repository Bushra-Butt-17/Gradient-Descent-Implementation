## Problem Description 🔍

In **Multiple Linear Regression**, the goal is to model the relationship between multiple independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target). The aim is to determine the coefficients that best fit the data, so the regression equation is as accurate as possible in predicting the target values.

The model assumes that the dependent variable is a linear combination of the independent variables. These coefficients (also called weights) are the values that the algorithm needs to optimize using **Gradient Descent**.

### MSE Equation:

The equation for MSE is given as:

## Gradient Descent 🔽

**Gradient Descent** is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the **cost function** (in this case, **Mean Squared Error**) by adjusting the model's parameters (the regression coefficients). It works by calculating the gradient (the partial derivatives) of the cost function with respect to each parameter. The parameters are then updated in the direction of the steepest descent (i.e., the negative gradient), which gradually reduces the cost.

In each iteration of the algorithm, the coefficients are updated by a small amount proportional to the gradient and the **learning rate**, which controls how big the step is.

### Key Steps in Gradient Descent:
1. **Initialize the coefficients** (weights) randomly.
2. **Calculate the prediction error** by comparing the predicted output with the actual target.
3. **Compute the gradient** (i.e., the derivative of the cost function) with respect to each coefficient.
4. **Update the coefficients** by subtracting a small proportion of the gradient from each coefficient.
5. Repeat the steps until the model's predictions converge or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Cost Function (MSE) 📉

The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is a common cost function used in regression problems. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better fit, meaning the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.

In this project, **Gradient Descent** aims to minimize the MSE by adjusting the regression coefficients. The cost function guides the model to find the best possible coefficients that reduce prediction errors.

## Results and Evaluation 📊

### Learning Curve 📉

The learning curve tracks the change in the **cost function** over iterations of Gradient Descent. This demonstrates how the algorithm gradually converges towards the minimum cost. A typical learning curve should show a rapid decrease initially, followed by slower convergence as the algorithm nears the optimal solution.

### 3D Plot 🌐

A **3D plot** is used to visualize the cost function's surface for two regression coefficients, illustrating how **Gradient Descent** converges to the optimal parameter values. It shows the path taken by the algorithm to find the minimum point.

### Explanations of Key Concepts 📐

#### Gradient Descent Update Rule

The core idea behind **Gradient Descent** is to iteratively adjust the model's coefficients in the direction that reduces the cost function. In each iteration:
- The coefficients are updated by a small amount in the direction opposite to the gradient of the cost function with respect to the coefficients.
- This process continues until the cost function stabilizes (i.e., the coefficients no longer change significantly) or a pre-defined number of iterations is reached.

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

The **Mean Squared Error** is the average of the squared differences between the actual target values and the predicted values of the model. Minimizing this error ensures that the regression model makes predictions that are as close as possible to the actual values.

The goal of the gradient descent algorithm is to find the coefficients that minimize the MSE, ultimately leading to a model that accurately predicts the target variable.
