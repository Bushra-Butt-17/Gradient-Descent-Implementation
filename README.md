## Problem Description 🔍  

In **Multiple Linear Regression**, the objective is to model the relationship between one dependent variable (target) and multiple independent variables (features). The task involves determining the regression coefficients that minimize the error in predictions.  

The model assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target. Using **Gradient Descent**, the coefficients are optimized iteratively to achieve the best fit, reducing the prediction errors.

## Gradient Descent 🔽  

**Gradient Descent** is an optimization technique that minimizes a cost function by iteratively updating the model’s parameters. The algorithm adjusts the coefficients in small steps, proportional to the negative gradient of the cost function, to move closer to the optimal solution.

### Key Steps:  
1. **Initialize coefficients** with random values or zeros.  
2. **Compute predictions** using the current coefficients.  
3. **Calculate the prediction error** by comparing predictions with actual values.  
4. **Adjust the coefficients** by subtracting a fraction of the gradient from each.  
5. Repeat until the cost function stabilizes or a maximum number of iterations is reached.  

The learning rate controls the size of the step taken at each iteration. Careful tuning of this parameter ensures the algorithm converges effectively.

## Cost Function (MSE) 📉  

The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. A lower MSE indicates that the model is performing well.  

In this project, **Gradient Descent** iteratively minimizes the MSE to find the optimal regression coefficients, ensuring that the model provides accurate predictions.
